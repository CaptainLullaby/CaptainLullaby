- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainLullaby
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Augmented Reality, Game Design and a good music :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and python in discord.py
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Tensorflow, CSS and anything related to keep me alive!

Right now just planning for higher studies and nothing new, always open for ideas and a good discussion.
